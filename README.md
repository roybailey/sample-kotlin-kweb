# An Example http://KWeb.io Web App 

This repository shows some samples of building a web page with kweb framework


### Getting Started

To build and run the application locally, from the repository root:

```
gradlew run
```


### Ideas from here

Basic samples from web worked, nice framework idea, clean and some neat use of
kotlin co-routines to hide the websocket asynchronous communications from the developer. 

My own HomePageApp example hit some issues with menu routing.  That along with the single
developer and lack of recent activity suggests it's one to come back in the future to see
if/how it develops.


### Thanks to...

The application was written using:

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [KWeb](https://kweb.io/)
